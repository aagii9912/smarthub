    // Re-reading the file: It takes pageId from params. 
    // It creates a shop with that pageId.

    // IF we are adhering strictly to the task: "Update setup-shop API to check limits"
    // I will add the check logic assuming we can get a handle on the subscription.
    // If the shop doesn't exist yet, we don't know the plan... 
    // Unless the PLAN is on the USER, not the SHOP.
    // The schema changes put subscription on the SHOP.

    // If subscription is on the SHOP, then creating a NEW shop means it starts with a default plan (Trial).
    // So the limit is actually a USER limit.
    // But we previously saw `shops` table has `subscription_plan`.

    // If each shop has its own subscription, then "Shop Creation Limits" implies:
    // A single USER (owner) cannot own more than X shops?
    // But if each shop pays separately, why limit it?

    // Maybe the requirement implies a "Account Level" plan? 
    // But our schema added subscription to the SHOP table.

    // HYPOTHESIS: The user meant "If I am on a Trial, I can only have 1 shop".
    // But if I create a NEW shop, it gets its OWN trial.
    // So 100 shops = 100 trials?
    // That might be what we want to prevent.

    // Let's assume we want to limit total shops per Facebook Account / User.
    // Since we don't have the User ID easily here without auth...

    // Let's look for where this API is called or if there is another `route.ts` that is authenticated.
    // This file `src/app/api/setup-shop/route.ts` seems like a dev/test endpoint or public callback?
